		<h1>Student Residency Makeup</h3>
		<div id='graph-residents'></div>
		<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), st."Residency"<br/>
FROM public."Student" st<br/>
GROUP BY st."Residency"
		</code>
		<p>This is useful, because our app only should focus on people who are residents.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Student Gender Makeup</h3>
		<div id='graph-gender'></div>
		<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), st."Gender"<br/>
FROM public."Student" st<br/>
GROUP BY st."Gender"
		</code>
		<p>We want to group people of similar genders because we feel like people would be more comfortable travelling with the same gender.<p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Students in Each Department</h3>
		<div id='graph-department'></div>
		<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), dp."DepartFullName"<br/>
FROM public."Student" st<br/>
LEFT JOIN "Department" dp ON st."DepartID" = dp."DepartID"<br/>
GROUP BY dp."DepartFullName";
		</code>
		<p>We wanted to see how many students we could group together that had similar interests.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Top 15 Cities With People From Texas Tech</h3>
		<div id='graph-origin'></div>
<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), ct."CityName"<br/>
FROM "Student" st<br/>
INNER JOIN "City" ct ON ct."CityID" = st."CityID"<br/>
GROUP BY ct."CityName"<br/>
HAVING ct."CityName" <> 'Lubbock'<br/>
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
</code>
		<p>We want to see where the most people are from, so we can determine which cities we want to market towards.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Grouping of Cities</h3>
		<div id='graph-city-count'></div>
<code>
SELECT * FROM CityGroup
</code>
<code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW CityGroup AS
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (<br/>
SELECT COUNT(*), ct."CityName"<br/>
FROM "Student" st<br/>
INNER JOIN "City" ct ON ct."CityID" = st."CityID"<br/>
GROUP BY ct."CityName"<br/>
HAVING COUNT(*) > 150<br/>
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC<br/>
) AS "P";
</code>
		<p>This breaks down the number of students by each city.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Top Cities Computer Science Students Are From</h3>
		<div id='graph-city-cs'></div>
<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), ct."CityName"<br/>
FROM "Student" st<br/>
INNER JOIN "City" ct ON ct."CityID" = st."CityID"<br/>
WHERE st."MajorID" = 146<br/>
GROUP BY ct."CityName"<br/>
HAVING ct."CityName" <> 'Lubbock'<br/>
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
</code>
		<p>Maybe grouping people by major isn't very feasible, due to the low numbers of people from each city with the same major.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h1>Interesting Statistics</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If we made everyone from the top 15 cities carpool together (in groups of 4), we would save <b>$1,921,920</b> in gas per year, if 4 trips were made by students per year (assuming one way is $40).
				<code>
SELECT COUNT(*), ct."CityName"<br/>
FROM "Student" st<br/>
INNER JOIN "City" ct ON ct."CityID" = st."CityID"<br/>
GROUP BY ct."CityName"<br/>
HAVING ct."CityName" <> 'Lubbock'<br/>
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC<br/>
LIMIT 15;
				</code>
			</li>
			<li>The probability of a random student having a carpool partner is 0.4 (40%).
				<code>
SELECT AVG(*) FROM<br/>
(<br/>
SELECT COUNT(*)<br/>
FROM "Student"<br/>
GROUP BY "CityID"<br/>
);
				</code>
			</li>
